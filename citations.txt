  Abstract                 = {This work concerns a novel study in the field of image-to-geometry registration. Our approach takes inspiration from medical imaging, in particular from multi-modal image registration. Most of the algorithms developed in this domain, where the images to register come from different sensors (CT, X-ray, PET), are based on Mutual Information, a statistical measure of non-linear correlation between two data sources. The main idea is to use mutual information as a similarity measure between the image to be registered and renderings of the model geometry, in order to drive the registration in an iterative optimization framework. We demonstrate that some illumination-related geometric properties, such as surface normals, ambient occlusion and reflection directions can be used for this purpose. After a comprehensive analysis of such properties we propose a way to combine these sources of information in order to improve the performance of our automatic registration algorithm. The proposed approach can robustly cover a wide range of real cases and can be easily extended.},

  Abstract                 = {Recording points of interest using \{GPS\} whilst working in the field is an established technique in geographical fieldwork, where the user′s current position is used as the spatial reference to be captured; this is known as geo-tagging. We outline the development and evaluation of a smartphone application called Zapp that enables geo-tagging of any distant point on the visible landscape. The ability of users to log or retrieve information relating to what they can see, rather than where they are standing, allows them to record observations of points in the broader landscape scene, or to access descriptions of landscape features from any viewpoint. The application uses the compass orientation and tilt of the phone to provide data for a line of sight algorithm that intersects with a Digital Surface Model stored on the mobile device. We describe the development process and design decisions for Zapp present the results of a controlled study of the accuracy of the application, and report on the use of Zapp for a student field exercise. The studies indicate the feasibility of the approach, but also how the appropriate use of such techniques will be constrained by current levels of precision in mobile sensor technology. The broader implications for interactive query of the distant landscape and for remote data logging are discussed. },

Our solver is general and able to compute absolute camera pose from two 2D-3D correspondences for single or multi-camera systems. We run several synthetic experiments that demonstrate our algorithm's improved robustness to image and IMU noise compared to the current state of the art. Additionally, we run an image localization experiment that demonstrates the accuracy of our algorithm in real-world scenarios. Finally, we show that our algorithm provides increased performance for real-time model-based tracking compared to solvers that do not utilize the vertical direction and show our algorithm in use with an augmented reality application running on a Google Tango tablet.},

For this, we consider a similarity measure, the mutual information. Mutual information is a measure of the quantity of information shared by two signals (or two images in our case). Exploiting this measure allows our method to deal with different image modalities (real and synthetic). Furthermore, it handles occlusions and illumination changes. Results with synthetic (benchmark) and real image sequences, with static or mobile camera, demonstrate the robustness of the method and its ability to produce stable and precise pose estimations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Structure from Motion (SfM) provide large amounts of digital data from which virtual outcrops can be created. The accuracy of these surface reconstructions is critical for quantitative structural analysis. Assessment of LiDAR and SfM methodologies suggest that SfM results are comparable to high data-density LiDAR on individual surfaces. The effect of chosen acquisition technique on the full outcrop and the efficacy on its virtual form for quantitative structural analysis and prediction beyond single bedding surfaces, however, is less certain. Here, we compare the accuracy of digital virtual outcrop analysis with traditional field data, for structural measurements and along-strike prediction of fold geometry from Stackpole syncline. In this case, the SfM virtual outcrop, derived from \{UAV\} imagery, yields better along-strike predictions and a more reliable geological model, in spite of lower accuracy surface reconstructions than LiDAR. This outcome is attributed to greater coverage by \{UAV\} and reliable reconstruction of a greater number of bedding planes than terrestrial LiDAR, which suffers from the effects of occlusion. Irrespective of the chosen acquisition technique, we find that workflows must incorporate careful survey planning, data processing and quality checking of derived data if virtual outcrops are to be used for robust structural analysis and along-strike prediction. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Although paper and pencil approaches to geological mapping continue, digital mapping tools are being increasing implemented in field geology. Of particular note is the use of an electronic compass/inclinometer built into tablets and smartphones for obtaining orientation data where an important question is the reliability of these digital devices relative to conventional, analogue compass/inclinometers. This paper deals with this question through detailed tests of two android devices: an Honor 3C smartphone and a Lenovo B8080-F tablet. In order to evaluate potential electronic noise effects the devices were tested in two modes, standard and airplane. Over 14,000 readings from the sensors were collected to evaluate the stability of the sensor's readings and showed that the magnetic sensor in the tablet was unacceptably unstable. Seven geological compass applications were installed on the Honor 3C smartphone and tested against the analogue Freiberg geological compass in a field experiment. During the experiment 25 fractures varying in azimuth and dip were measured using both devices. A high level of disagreement was observed with discrepancies as high as 80 degree with azimuthal errors dominant. Analysis of the time series in the data suggest the source of the problem was instability in the magnetic sensor for the smartphone, despite the fact the device passed the initial stability test. Although only two devices were studied these data indicate care must be taken to evaluate compass accuracy on these devices.},

The method is parallelizable and scalable to very large models. The algorithm is based on the local multi-resolution approaches provided by the community, but ad-hoc solutions had to be studied and implemented to provide adequate performances. In particular, a compression mechanism that reached very high compression rate without impact on rendering performance was implemented. Moreover, the data partition strategy was modified in order to be able to load different types of data (i.e. point clouds) and better adapt to the potentials and limitations of web-based rendering. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Urban scenes acquisition is very often performed using laser scanners onboard a vehicle. In parallel, color information is also acquired through a set of coarsely aligned camera pictures. The question of combining both measures naturally arises for adding color to the 3D points or enhancing the geometry, but it faces important challenges. Indeed, 3D geometry acquisition is highly accurate while the images suffer from distortion and are only coarsely registered to the geometry. In this paper, we introduce a two-step method to register images to large-scale complex point clouds. Our method performs the image-to-geometry registration by iteratively registering the real image to a synthetic image obtained from the estimated camera pose and the point cloud, using either reflectance or normal information. First a coarse registration is performed by generating a wide-angle synthetic image and considering that small pitch and yaw rotations can be estimated as translations in the image plane. Then a fine registration is performed using a new image metric which is adapted to the difference of modality between the real and synthetic images. This new image metric is more resilient to missing data and large transformations than standard Mutual Information. In the process, we also introduce a method to generate synthetic images from a 3D point cloud that is adapted to large-scale urban scenes with occlusions and sparse areas. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively on datasets of urban scans and associated images. },

  Abstract                 = {Storage capacity is a key aspect when validating potential CO2 sequestration sites. Most CO2 storage projects, for obvious reasons, target conventional aquifers (e.g., saline aquifers, depleted hydrocarbon fields) with good reservoir properties and ample subsurface data. However, non-geological factors, such as proximity to the CO2 source, may require storing CO2 in geologically ``less-than-ideal'' sites. We here present a first-order CO2 storage resource estimate of such an unconventional storage unit, a naturally fractured, compartmentalized and underpressured siliciclastic aquifer located at 670--1,000 m below Longyearbyen, Arctic Norway. Water injection tests confirm the injectivity of the reservoir. Capacity calculations, based on the US DOE guidelines for CO2 storage resource estimation, were implemented in a stochastic volumetric workflow. All available data were used to specify input parameters and their probability distributions. The areal extent of the compartmentalized reservoir is poorly constrained, encouraging a scenario-based approach. Other high-impact parameters influencing storage resource estimates include CO2 saturation, CO2 density and the storage efficiency factor. The hydrodynamic effects of storing CO2 in a compartmentalized aquifer are accounted for by calculating probable storage efficiency factors (0.04--0.79 {\%}) in a fully closed system. The results are ultimately linked to the chosen scenario, with two orders of magnitude difference between scenarios. The fracture network contributes with up to 2 {\%} to the final volumes. The derived workflow validates CO2 storage sites based on initial feasibility assessments, and may be applied to aid decision making at other unconventional CO2 storage sites with significant data uncertainty.},
